In this github repository you can find some examples of my work which show my skills.

The 'Notebook_RandomForest' is a short version of my master thesis, where I used sampling methods to overcome the imbalance problem using Random Forests for a multiple class classification.

The Word document called 'unbalanced_random_forest' is a brief overview of my thesis.

All those examples can also be found on my linkedin page:
